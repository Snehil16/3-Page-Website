      <h1>Crisis due to Covid-19</h1>
      <p id="para">Food prices soared dramatically worldwide owing to COVID-19 supply chain disruptions and increased consumer demand, worsening the situation for the 811 million people who go to bed hungry every night.

      Since 2019, there are now 345 million more people experiencing acute food insecurity, up from 135 million. 50 million people worldwide, spread over 45 nations, are on the verge of being hungry.</p>

      <h1>Crisis due to War</h1>
      <p id="para">The prognosis for already skyrocketing global food costs was further exacerbated by Russia's invasion of Ukraine in february.

      <h1>Crisis due to Climate Shock</h1>
      <p id="para">Global food production is already under danger from climate change and its effects on extreme weather, fires, pests, and illnesses. The poorest and most vulnerable people will suffer disproportionately if we don't take immediate action, and instability will rise.</p>

    <div id="block4">
      <h1>Crisis due to High Prices</h1>
      <p id="para">During the COVID-19 pandemic, food costs have sharply increased, although the causes are complicated and go beyond the virus's impact on public health. Unprecedented bottlenecks and delays in the worldwide supply chain have had an impact on virtually every aspect of our lives, such as the food we eat.</p>
